# String matching
this repository is dedicated to fast yet efficient string matching using decision trees in memory.

# Language
code is written in C/C++ for faster processing.

# Matching Architecture
This code is an implementation of KMP for exact match. 

# Roadmap
1. Support edit distance based on full string.
2. Support scrubbing words. These words are deemed low weighted and should will be removed from the matching process.
3. Support weight. These words have some importance to be defined and specific weight is applied in the matching process.
